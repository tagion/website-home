## Development

### Run in dev mode

```bash
# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Run in dev mode:
npm run dev
```

### Deployment

You can suggest changes by submitting a pull request. If the PR integrates well, it will be approved and the website automatically rebuilt thanks to Travis CI.

You should always make a pull request to the `stage` branch.

### Structure

Branch `gh-pages` contains built version of the website, while `release` and `stage` branches contain the source code.

The stage.tagion.org is hosted in [another repo](https://github.com/tagion/homepage.stage/), built from `stage` branch.

Site content (except promo pages) is in `/docs` folder. Everything else in `/docs/.vuepress`.

We don't use `master` branch since it is indexable by search engines, which makes duplicate content, which is bad for SEO.
