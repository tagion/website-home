# Crypto “Bank” bill

The bill has a value _V_, public/private key (_y, x_), and the bank bill number _B_, which is the hash of the bill.

V can have the value of a natural number: _V_ ∈ _N_
This is a newly printed bill:

(_H_ is a hash function, is the hash of the previous confirmed Bull’s eye, is the consensus timestamp of the current Epoch, is the epoch number, and _T_ is the contact type).
The total value of all bills of type _T_ must be accounted for.

**Simple transaction** - Ownership of the bill can be transferred to Bob, if:

- Bob reveals his public key to Alice.
- Alice generates a new bill and signs it with her private key. Because of the network fee, the value will be reduced by _∆V_.

If ![](https://i.imgur.com/GACAKq5.png) is negative or zero, the transaction is eliminated, and will not generate a new bill.

The new bill is now written to the **DART** with key ![](https://i.imgur.com/bd1zFkn.png)

The old bill ![](https://i.imgur.com/ukUAT9y.png) is removed from the **DART**.

**The Split of a crypto bill**
A bill can be split into several other bills if the combined value of the new nodes matches the original:

Each new bill is generated as:

All new bills marked ![](https://i.imgur.com/jdD2URg.png) are stored in the **DART** as before, and the old bills are removed. Join or collect bills into one bill.

Several bills can be collated into one bill if the value adds up as follows:

The new common bill number is generated by hashing a sorted list of the joined bill numbers.

The new bill number will be generated:

These new consolidated bills are stored in the **DART**.
