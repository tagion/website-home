# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Tagion is new money that you can use without banks. It was designed from a clean slate to serve as an efficient **medium of exchange**, convenient **unit of account**, and a reliable **store of value**.


Here you will find an overview of what makes Tagion **different** from other crypto projects and legacy currencies. If you want to go deeper - take a look at our [tech paper](/tagion-tech-paper.pdf).

## Tagion VS Crypto

### Adaptive token supply

The speculative nature of cryptocurrencies is hurting their **adoption** in the **real economy**. That is why Tagion's token supply is **controlled by the algorithm**, which uses internal metrics, like quantity and velocity of money in the system. Simply put, the total supply will always try to **stabilize** at a level accounted for adoption.

### Governance

Tagion is **governed collectively** as a common resource. All decisions are made on the network via weighted voting. People who contribute more have more say in the system. Also, the network rewards all contributors, not only those who validate transactions.

### Technology

Innovative aBFT consensus mechanism (Hashgraph) enables sharding for **scalability** and real DEX with price-matching for **interoperability**.

## Tagion VS Legacy

### Cryptographic ownership

Tagion is a cryptocurrency, which means **ownership** of a "bill" is **guaranteed** by using **cryptographic signatures**. Instead of relying on banks, one can use math to transfer money.

To spend a tagion bill, you must digitally "sign it" using its private key, usually stored locally on your device. Without the correct key, the transaction is not valid, and the network will ignore it.


### Fast settlement

In the legacy banking system, the final settlement of money transfers takes days; this is why we use intermediaries like Visa and Mastercard who pre-confirm transactions (for a fee). In Tagion, the** final settlement** usually takes **less than a minute**, while the alternative to **pre-confirmation** (depending on your payment app) **takes seconds**.

### Native integrations

Tagion is **native** to the digital world, meaning it can be integrated **directly** into **apps** and **games** without the need of banks or service providers. 

### Reliability

**Tagion database software** is free and available for all to use. It connects computers into **one large network**, that collectively make up **one large database**. The data (mostly **tagion bills**) is replicated across the whole network, making it highly accessible and practically impossible to temper with.
