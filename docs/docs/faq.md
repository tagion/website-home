## General

### What is Tagion

Tagion is digital money that can be used without banks.

### How Tagion works

Tagion can be seen as **one large network** of computers, that collectively make up **one large database**. That database holds all Tagion bills and processes incoming transactions. Transactions are instructions to destroy input bill, and transfer its value to output bill; each input bill must be digitally signed by its private key.

Users keep private keys to their bills (in the "wallet apps"). When the user wants to transfer some money, he just needs to send the valid transaction to the network.
