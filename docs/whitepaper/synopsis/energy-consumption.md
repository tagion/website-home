# Energy Consumption

_Bitcoin mining accounts for 0.29% of the world's annual electricity consumption. Mining of a single bitcoin block consumes enough energy to power more than 28 U.S. homes for a day. Tagion consumes 10,000% less energy, compared to Bitcoin._

In the world of cryptos it is well known that the most popular networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are anything but energy conscious, as they lean against the proof-of-work protocol . Tagion’s proof-of-people protocol uses insignificant, close to zero, energy compared to proof-of-work. 

The hashgraph consensus mechanism, DART, and the lean script executions allows Tagion to be operated on low powered commodity hardware, such Smartphones. In comparison, banks are settling transactions with other banks by use of multiple mainframe-based systems and proof-of-work based cryptosystems are demanding an ever-increasing share of the total power consumed world-wide.
