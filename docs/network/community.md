# Community

Join the **network community** of creators, educators, entrepreneurs, and investors. We govern the network by:

- improving core protocols and algorithms;
- implementing core software;
- running network nodes;
- educating people about Tagion;
- making partnerships;
- voting for improvement proposals.

When Tagion is fully launched, the governance will become fully algorithmic, integrated into the network. Newly "printed" tagions and voting points will be distributed among contributors, based on recognition of their contribution value by peers.

Before that, our community lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/tagion/community), where we keep track of all [proposals](https://github.com/tagion/community/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atip), ongoing [projects](https://github.com/tagion/community/projects) and [discussion](https://github.com/tagion/community/discussions). Don't be shy and [say hi](https://github.com/tagion/community/discussions/1)!
