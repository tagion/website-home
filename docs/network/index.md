# The network

üëã Welcome to the **network side** of Tagion!

In simple terms, Tagion is a decentralized database where [Tagion bills](/money/) are stored, and transactions are processed. 

We believe that everybody should have equal rights to the money, so nobody can cheat or manipulate the system, as we saw happening around the world so many times. Tagion network enables money that can be used freely without asking for permission.

There are two components that make Tagion possible:

1. Tagion database **software**;
2. Tagion **governance** rules.

## Software

**Tagion database software** is free and available for all to use. It connects computers into **one large network**, that collectively make up **one large database**. The data (mostly **tagion bills**), is replicated across the whole network, making it highly accessible and practically impossible to temper with.

Even though the data is stored publically, tagion bills remain entirely anonymous. Only the owner of the bill can spend it (thank you üôè cryptography).

## Governance

Tagion governance rules are **written as programs** and stored in the [database](#software) mentioned above. These rules will execute no matter what, **without human intervention**. They define **how** new **participants join** the network, which **protocols they use** and how tagions are **"printed"** or **"burned"** (controlling total supply).

Though sometimes, the rules have to change (e.g., the version of a protocol). To replace the rule in governance, the majority of voting power in the network must agree on the new rule. 

The **voting power** is **distributed** across participants based on the **recognition of their contribution** by other participants. Those who contribute more have more say in the system.
