Tagion is a money system governed openly, as a common good. Anybody can participate in governance, support network's reliability and influence its development.

Most of tagions created in the system are distributed across governance members (some distributed randomly to active users).

## Overview
![](/diagrams/network.drawio.svg)

Tagion network is made up of many computers running certain version of the software, that implements certain protocols.

- These computers belong to people like us;
- That software and protocols are created by people like us;
- We collectively define the rules of the system, thus governing it.

Protocols define the governance rules, which in turn control how the software is updated, how new computers can join and how many tokens should the contributors receive.

In the end, governance comes down to voting, which happens inside the network, where every governance member can participate and cast his voting power, earned by contributing to the network over the long period of time.
