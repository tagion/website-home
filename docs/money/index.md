# The money

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the **money side** of Tagion!

**Tagion** is a digital money system - **medium of exchange**, **unit of account** and **store of value**. Tagions exist as data in [the network](/network/). You can use tagions natively via apps that support it, without banks or other intermediaries.

## Features

### Cryptographic ownership

To spend a tagion bill, you must digitally "sign it" using its private key. These keys are usually stored securely on your device. Without the correct key, the transaction is not valid, and the network will ignore it.

### Low fees

Tagion transactions are cheap. No matter where and how much you transfer, most of the time, you'll pay a fraction of $0.01 equivalent.

### Fast transactions

In the legacy banking system, final settlement for money transfer takes days; this is why we use intermediaries like Visa and Mastercard that guarantee transactions faster (but take a fee). In Tagion, the final settlement usually takes less than a minute, and the alternative to pre-confirmation takes seconds.

### Native integrations

Tagion is native to the digital world, meaning it can be integrated into any application without the need of banks or service providers. Tagions can integrate with apps we usually use in our daily life.
