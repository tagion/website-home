# The Money

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the **money side** of Tagion!

[Tagion network](/network/) enables **tagions** - the money that **just exist** for all to use, that **can <u>not</u> be manipulated nor taken down nor censored**. Money as they should be - **medium of exchange**, **unit of account** and **store of value**.

## Features

### Cryptographic ownership

To spend a tagion bill, you must digitally "sign it" using its private key. These keys are usually stored securely on your own device. Without the right key, the transaction is not valid, and the network will simply ignore it.

### Low fees

Tagion transcation are really cheap. No matter where and how much you transfer, most of the time you'll pay a fraction of $0.01 equivalent.

### Fast transactions

In the legacy banking system, final settlement for money transfer takes days, this is why we use systems like Visa and Mastercard that preconfirm transactions (but take a fee). In Tagion, final settlement usually takes less than a minute, and alternative to pre-confirmation may take seconds.

### Native integrations

Tagion is native to digital world, meaning it can be integrated into any application without the need of banks or service providers. Tagions can be integrated into apps we normally use in our daily life.
