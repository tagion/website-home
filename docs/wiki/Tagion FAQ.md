## General Tagion
**What is Tagion Program?**

Group of projects with a goal of launching the TPN () and achieving its true decentralization. The program is managed under Tagion Program GitHub organization.
 The scope of the program includes:
 - Development and standartization of Tagion Protocols;
- Development of the Tagion Origin client;
- Development of tools for ecosystem developers;
- Development of community;
- Development of knowledge base.

**What is Tagion?**

Decentralized non-political monetary system, used and governed openly as a common good.

**What is TPN?**

TPN stands for Tagion Protocols Network. Actual network of computers, running software that follows Tagion Protocols - TPN clients. There can be only one true TPN due to protection from accidental forks.

**Who governs Tagion?**

The users of the system  govern Tagion by a reputational trust score model and Proof of Community model.

More, we are trying to extend the governance model to reward all actors in the model, which could be divided into four main categories:
* Sense-makers: core concept developers;
* Value-makers: programmers and nodes
* Relation makers: evangelists and services on top
* Decision-makers: core developers and node operators.

**What is the business model behind Tagion?**

The business model behind Tagion is to allow network participants, such as nodes and service providers, to make money either by being rewarded for helping with operating the network (nodes) or from earning money from services being provided on top of the network, e.g., fees and interests (service providers).

**What is a Node?**

Defining a node is done from democratic principles, where all can participate and where one person has one vote. These principles are translated into a permissionless system where one node has one vote, where one person only controls one node. It would ensure the full distribution of nodes because centralization is not possible.

**What is a Hashgrapg?**

Hashgraph is a new consensus alternative to the blockchain. It uses a gossip protocol that works in the following manner: Every node in Hashgraph can spread signed information (called events) on newly-created transactions and transactions received from others to its randomly chosen neighbors.

**What is a Proof of Comunity protocol?**

 The Proof-of-Comunity protocol is a heuristic protocol with a random and social component. Heuristic because it aims to secure the democratic principles of one person, one node, and an actual person behind a node. One person, one node, cannot be accomplished, but the social component would approximate this. The social component makes managing more than one node difficult, and the scoring mechanism makes it less favourable. The approximation would ensure a highly distributed system when it is combined with a random selection of new prospect nodes. It means no actor or a few actors would control the network when the number of nodes has a certain size, making it secure.
 
**Is Tagion compliant (Financial regulation)?**

* Tagion follows a dualistic approach to regulation giving privacy in the network for its users and making it possible for the users and service providers to exchange compliance records seamlessly and efficiently, where the users control the data. By this, the service providers can cater to local regulations.
* Tagion does not have embedded compliance to any jurisdiction. In that aspect, the network is totally neutral. So, every legal entity must be compliant with its local jurisdiction.

**What is Tagion DEX?**

* **A DEX** is a decentralized exchange that allows people to place orders and trade cryptocurrencies without an intermediary institution managing the ledger or controlling user funds. However, close to all DEX don’t have a pair matching due to the lack of consensus ordering. Also, even though the exchange itself is decentralized, the matching is still centralized (may be open-source in some cases, though).
* **Tagion DEX** is an open protocol that enables a trustless digital currency exchange that supports HTLC (Hash Time-Locked Contract). Thanks to the fair ordering of transactions enabled by Hashgraph, Tagion DEX also provides automatic ‘on-chain’ pair matching.
Once completed, Tagion’s DEX will seamlessly exchange between all common crypto and FIAT currencies (semi-decentralized). Read more in the White Paper.

 
**What is Adaptive money supply, and how does it work?**

 Adaptive currency automatically increases and decreases in volume with the demands of the money. Tagion is inspired by the equation of exchange trying to maintain a stable internal price level by regulating the money supply based on the speed of money and adoption of the system. The adoption is an arbitrary measure of the underlying commodities Tagions are used to Trade. Sophisticated algorithm burns and spins of money to secure a stable value of Tagions.
 
 **How to get Tagions, and to start with them?**
 
 **Now:**
* You can earn Tagions through a social campaign.
* You’ll also be able to earn Tagions by running the node network.

**After launch:**
* Become a Node by running a **TPN client**.
* Buy tagions from a local exchange.
