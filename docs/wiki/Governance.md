  Tagion is a common resource(s) that constitutes the network, Tagion trademark, code, and governance mechanisms, which a common resource governance model governs. The model is based on Elinor Ostrom's ideas and design principles with (self-)governing of the commons. The overall perception of resource governance in today's society is between private or state ownership extremes. There is a third option called Commons, which can be translated to self-governance or community governance. Elinor Ostrom argues and proves, it is much more efficient when it comes to governing common resources. She won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009 for her work within the field [7, 6]. We believe a monetary system and banking network should be a common resource because all users have an equal interest in the system; thus, the system should serve all interests equally by being governed as a common resource. Designing a governance model for a common requires clear rules for the system's boundaries, resources, and actors, which is described in this chapter. [8, 2, 5] Tagion has three main governance types listed in table 1 and elaborated in the following sub-sections. More the common resources of Tagion are elaborated in section 1.4.

 Table 1: Overview of the three main governance types for the system: Node, Economic, and
System Upgrade Governance:



| Governance Type | Purpose                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node            | Defines rules and processes for nodes. I.e. algorithms controlling the node scoring model and proof-of-people protocol. |
| Economic        | Defines rules and processes for ecnomics in the system.
System Upgrade                                        |Defines rules and processes for system upgrades.
