**Abstract**

This paper describes an alternative implementation of a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) network compared to a classical network such as Bitcoin. Most other DLT networks use the Prof-of-Work consensus mechanism to secure Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) of the data storage. In the Tagion network, the BFT is based on the Hashgraph algorithm and data storage on a new type of Distributed Hash Table (DHT), making it efficient to maintain a distributed database and guarantee BFT. The Hashgraph algorithm is deterministic and not probabilistic, allowing the ordering of transactions. The order of transactions combined with the Lightning Network and the Tagion matching and settlement protocol constitutes a Decentralised Exchange (DEX) protocol on the Tagion network. A new governance model is proposed to reduce the probability of the network being taken over by an evil group of actors, which does not rely on a central control or a group of master nodes. It is built on the ideas of self-governance of common resources and democratic principles resulting in a Proof-of People protocol and reputational scoring model that relies on the nodes to engage in dialogue with each other.
