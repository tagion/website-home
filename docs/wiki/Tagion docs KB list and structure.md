# Docs we need to have

[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/GmNG0SXHSRig9V3PGo_ivg/badge)](https://hackmd.io/GmNG0SXHSRig9V3PGo_ivg)

We can organize Tagion’s docs structure in a few separate sections, like:

## Audiences

- GEN - General
    - Other parties, that just getting familiar with the project on conceptual level. Enterprises or small businesses that look into cutting payment system costs or utilize the public ledger, people looking into long-term investments with the goal to keep the value of their savings.
- TPC - Tagion Program Contributors
    - Contribute knowledge and code to Tagion Program products (node, wallet, sdk etc.)
- DEV - Developers
    - Create solutions that utilize Tagion Program products or the network in general.
- TPN - TPN Nodes
    - Those who "seed" the network, by running the TPN Client on their machine to support the network, earn rewards, and not having to trust anyone other than themselves when performing transactions.


# Contributors community (TPC)

These communities live in Discord, social media and most importantly on GitHub.

* Contribution guide
    * Code contribution -> pull requests, code style, git style
    * Problem reporting -> issue creation
* Code of conduct (community member dos and donts)
    * Full version (github)
    * Short version (chats and forums like discord, reddit)


# Tagion home website (TPN/GEN)

Website is for consumers for Tagion Program products (desktop node and possible desktop wallet). The site should introduce the newcomer to Tagion, and make it easy to download, and start a node.

## Developer guide (DEV)

This is mostly for DEV, because TPC will hang out on GitHub of the Tagion projects. The ones who want to build their own apps, will use these docs to learn how to use the API, how to store data in Tagion, how to process payments.

* Getting started (step by step instructions on how to start working with the Tagion system).
    * Create compatible wallet (crypto key generation) via SDK
    * Creating the contract (transaction)
    * Sending the contract and tracking its status
    * Reading from the Tagion database
* List of SDK, libraries that can be used in your application
* Tutorials (texts and/or video (if we’d like to support such format).
    * E.g. Accept donations on your website
