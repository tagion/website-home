# Welcome to Docs

Documentation is work in progress, but as soon as Tagion team has something to share, it will appear in this section.

You can check the [Roadmap](/community/roadmap.md) to see what's coming.

## Funnel Documentation

Funnel is an official scripting engine for Tagion Network. It is based on Forth programming language. 

Learn more about [Funnel](/docs/funnel.md).

## Funnel Scripting Engine

Scripting Engine is a component of Tagion Node software. Though at the moment, it is available as a separate package, so developers can get familiar with the Funnel language and try executing some scripts.

[Execute your first Funnel script with Docker](/docs/scripting-engine.md).
