The Tagion network is a common resource meaning any state or private entity should not own it because it serves a common purpose of the whole community and users of the system.
The resources are the actual network, governance mechanism, and all the IP (intellectual property) related to Tagion, listed below.

##  Open Source code


The source code is released under a GNU GPL or similar license and owned by the Tagion Foundation. The licensing is in process. Closed or commercial projects do need permission to
use the source code. At the moment, the git repository is not open. Preparations to open the repository are being made. Before the open-source license is defined and the open patent license has been given to the Tagion Foundation from I25S ApS, the repository cannot be opened. It is planned to open the project as soon as possible. People with legitimate reasons to verify the code can write to info@tagion.org, and a copy of the source code can be shared after a signed NDA is in place.

##  Patents

EU patents are filed in the company name I25S ApS. The patents concern 1) a database system and 2) and network gossip protocol. The database system, which is implemented as the DART in Tagion, is a distributed database system that can efficiently search and store data based on a cryptographic hash enabling the network to execute transactions in parallel, enabling performance and scalability. The gossip protocol is an efficient way to share information among all members of the network.

## Open Licenses


An open license is defined to be a gratis patent license given to the open-source project that cannot be revoked. All open-source projects have the same type of license as the Tagion Project has, as a rule of thumb, granted a free license that cannot be revoked automatically.
Other open-source projects need to apply for an open license. The licenses cannot be revoked when first given. I25S gives the Tagion Foundation and project an open license. Projects that fork the Tagion code need an open license by default.

## “Tagion” Trademark


An EU Trademark is registered for “Tagion” and owned by the Tagion Foundation, including related internet domains. The trademark is to make sure that projects, which are forking the source and governance model, cannot call themselves Tagion XYC. It confuses the end-users and community; thus, multiple projects with similar names should be avoided. Tagion can protect itself from other projects or entities that wish to associate with Tagion for malicious purposes.
