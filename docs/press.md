## Stage of development

The team behind tagion aims to launch the network by the end of 2021. Initially, the network will be open for all to use but require permission to participate in governance. Once the adoption reaches an acceptable level, the governance will start to open up in stages. The team expects this to happen between 2022 - 2023.
