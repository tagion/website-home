## About Tagion

Tagion is a universal token protocol. We aim to solve problems such as digital currency interoperability, inflation and deflation, decentralized governance, and scalability.

## Projects

Internal projects include:

- **Tagion Protocol** - combination of core protocols;
- **Tagion SDK** - tools for developers;
- **Tagion Node** - implementation of network node software;
- **Tagion Wallet** - implementation of basic wallet functionality.

All listed projects are either open-source or will be open-sourced soon, once the codebase and documentation is prepared for public.

## Differentiators

#### Hashgraph

Instead of Blockchain with proof of work, Tagion is based on Hashgraph consensus mechanism. 

> It is an asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) consensus algorithm that they consider capable of securing the platform against attacks. It does not use miners to validate transactions, and uses directed acyclic graphs for time-sequencing transactions without bundling them into blocks.

##### Is Hashgraph Patented?

No, the Hashgraph mathematical proof itself is not patented, because only inventions can be patented, not the science itself as the mathematical proof. 

Swirlds own the US Patent_9,646,029_B1 claiming a distributed database system that reaches consensus with a proof of stake model and the Hashgraph algorithm.

Swirlds have filed the patent in US and Australia. The patent application got refusal in Korea and has chosen not to continue the national phase in Germany (EU).

Tagion used the math behind Hashgrpaph in a completely different way, in a different context, which is its P2P distributed database technology.

Tagion as well filed patents in EU, that are related to the gossip and security mechanisms and the database technology.

#### Decentralized Exchange Protocol

The Hashgraph enables the fair ordering of transactions in a decentralized manner. It makes possible to exchange digital currencies without trusting a middleman.


#### Inclusive Governance

Tagion has several layers of governance and built on democratic principles. The network and the code belong to all its users. More about governance on [Tagion Forum](https://forum.tagion.org/c/governance/8).

#### Elastic Money Supply

The fixed hard cap on money supply makes deflationary currency, creating an incentive to hold on to money instead of spending them, which is undesired due to economic reasons. Tagion solves it with an elastic money supply that will expand and contract depending on internal metrics that reflect adoption.
