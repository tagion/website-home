# For Press

Tagion is a cryprocurrency project, founded by [Theis Simonsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theis-simonsen-32035313/), [Carsten Rasmussen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carsten-bleser-rasmussen-80699915/) and [Kristian Vestergaard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristian-vestergaard-a59b4a/).

The project combines multiple innovative technologies to enable truly decenetralized and scalable cryptocurrency that can be used as money in our everyday life.

## Tagion Goal

Tagion aims to become the most convenient **medium of exchange** and a reliable **store of value**. All decisions throughout project development were and will be driven by this goal.

## Tagion Features

### Open Governance

Tagion addresses governance problem from day one. The aim is to have a decentralized governance system open for all to join.

Tagion governance consists of following layers:

- Node governance

### Anonymity

Tagion money exist similar to cash bills. Tagion bill is stored in the database as a separate record, once used, the new bill is created.

> The team believes "money must not smell"

### Consensus Mechanism

Instead of Blockchain with proof of work, Tagion is based on Hashgraph consensus mechanism.

> It is an asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) consensus algorithm that they consider capable of securing the platform against attacks. It does not use miners to validate transactions, and uses directed acyclic graphs for time-sequencing transactions without bundling them into blocks.

### Adaptive Money Supply

## Stage of Development

The team behind tagion aims to launch the network by the end of 2021. Initially the network will be open for all to use, but require permission to participate in governance. Once the adoption reaches acceptable level, the governance will start to open up in stages. The team expects this to happen between 2022 - 2023.
